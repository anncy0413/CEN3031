        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">A strong chest enhances pushing power, improves posture, and balances upper body aesthetics. Training your chest helps with daily activities like pushing doors and stabilizes the shoulders during compound lifts. A well-developed chest also protects your shoulders by taking on load during upper body exercises.</p>
