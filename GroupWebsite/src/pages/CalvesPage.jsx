                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Before training calves, perform 5-10 minutes of light cardio followed by dynamic stretches. Dynamic stretches like eccentric calf raises, downward dog, and zombie walks will decrease your risk of injury by increasing blood flow to the muscle and activating your calves for exercise.</p>
